# Hypixel-optimal-compost-script
This is a simple python script that tells you what items are the best to put into the compost
NOTE: there's a 40k limit on organic matter on the compost machine, if you want the optimal method, put the most efficient item minus one, then fill it up with smaller amounts just since I didn't account for the 40k limit yet
